# Boruvka's MST Algorithm

This project contains an implementation of Boruvka's Algorithm

The files contain:
* `main.py` - The implementation of Boruvkas Algorithm
* `Graph.py` - A minimal implementation of a Graph
* `Borůvka_Report.pdf` - A written report detailing the algorithm
* `Borůvka_Slides.pdf` - Slides written for a presentation.

To run the algorithm:
```python
python main.py
```

Requirements:
- Matplotlib
- Networkx

I completed this project whilst undertaking the ECM3428 module at the University of Exeter - full PDF specification can be found in *specification.pdf*
